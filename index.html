 <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
   <p>My name is Rose James, a graduate of Biochemistry from the University of Port Harcourt. During my time at the university, I had the opportunity to work remotely with several U.S.-based companies, including Wellnite and Futuristics Job, which helped shape my professional experience and broaden my global perspective.
Beyond academics and work, I am passionate about singing and writing—both creative outlets that allow me to express my heart and faith. I deeply love the Lord, and my relationship with Him is at the center of who I am.
I am blessed with a small circle of genuine and true-hearted people. These friends understand the value of real friendship and mutual growth. Though I’ve experienced fallouts with some who were only meant for a season, I believe their time in my life served its purpose—and then it was time to let go.My personal mantra is: "God is aware of anything that happens in my life, and everything that happens, happens for a reason." This belief guides my perspective, fuels my resilience, and helps me walk confidently into every new chapter.
